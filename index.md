The "computable" numbers may be described briefly as the real
numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means.
Although the subject of this paper is ostensibly the computable numbers.
it is almost equally easy to define and investigate computable functions
of an integral variable or a real or computable variable, computable
predicates, and so forth. The fundamental problems involved are,
however, the same in each case, and I have chosen the computable numbers
for explicit treatment as involving the least cumbrous technique. I hope
shortly to give an account of the relations of the computable numbers,
functions, and so forth to one another. This will include a development
of the theory of functions of a real variable expressed in terms of computable
numbers. According to my definition, a number is computable
if its decimal can be written down by a machine...

# Introduction

- The rocket landing problem is formulated as an optimal control problem, where the goal is to achieve a soft landing at a specified terminal state while minimizing fuel consumption.
- Instead of integrating the continuous-time ODE directly, the trajectory is computed through a direct transcription approach.
- The continuous optimal control problem is converted into a finite-dimensional nonlinear programming (NLP) problem, solved using MATLAB’s *fmincon* with an SQP algorithm.
- A coarse-to-fine mesh refinement scheme is used to improve accuracy and ensure convergence of the optimal trajectory.

# Direct Collocation Method

 

- The time horizon $[0, t_f]$ is discretized into N nodes: $t_1, t_2, ... t_N$
- Step size: $h = \frac{t_f}{N-1}$
- State and control values at each node become optimization variables.
- State trajectory x(t) is approximated using cubic Hermite polynomials expressed through:
    - Node values: $x_i$
    - Node derivatives: $f_i = f(x_i, u_i)$
- Control inputs $u(t)$are linearly interpolated between nodes.

- Dynamics are not integrated forward; instead, they are enforced at the midpoint between nodes.
- Midpoint state and control are computed as:
    - $x_c​=​\frac12(x_i​+x_{i+1}​)+\frac h8​(f_i​−f_{i+1}​)$
    - $u_c= \frac 12 (u_i + u_{i+1})$
    - $f_c = f(x_c, u_c)$
- Dynamic consistency is enforced through the Hermite–Simpson integration rule:
    - $x_{i+1} - x_i = \frac{h}{6}\left(f_i + 4f_c + f_{i+1}\right)$
- The above constraint is imposed for all intervals i=1,…,N−1, resulting in 5(N−1) equality constraints.
- These constraints ensure that the discrete trajectory approximates the continuous ODE with third-order accuracy.

# NLP Formulation

---

- All states and controls at every node are stacked into a single vector:
    - $P = [x_1,\; u_1,\; x_2,\; u_2,\; \cdots,\; x_N,\; u_N]$
- Dimension:
    - $\text{dim}(P) = N \times (n_x + n_u)$
- Fuel consumption is minimized by maximizing final mass:
    - $J = -m(t_f)$
- This formulation naturally aligns with minimizing integrated thrust expenditure.

# Experiment

---

1. **Optimization Variable P**
    - Treated as the decision variable of the nonlinear programming problem.
2. **Objective Function: Fuel Minimization (Equivalent to Maximizing Final Mass)**
    - The objective is formulated as $J=−m(t_f)$, which maximizes the final mass by minimizing fuel consumption.
3. **No Direct Integration of the ODE**
    - The state dynamics are not integrated explicitly; instead, dynamic feasibility is enforced through the collocation constraints.

# Result

---

## #1 Baseline Experiment (No Control Smoothing/ No Penalty Terms)

### **Key Features**

- Only the final mass is included in the objective function.
- Controls T(t) and α(t) are unconstrained in terms of smoothness.
- No penalty terms on state deviation, no penalty on increasing altitude.
- Only altitude constraint y≥0 and mass constraint $m \ge m_{\min}$ are enforced.

### **Analysis**

- The thrust and angle profiles exhibit discrete, piecewise-constant behavior.
    
    → This occurs because the optimizer is free to change controls abruptly without cost.
    
- The rocket trajectory shows an unexpected upward motion (increase in y) during the mid-phase.
    
    → Since the formulation contains **no penalty for increasing altitude**, the optimizer allows such motion if it helps reduce fuel usage in the later phase.
    
- The resulting path is mathematically feasible but **physically unrealistic**, demonstrating the need for additional structure or penalties in the optimization.

> Conclusion: The baseline formulation satisfies all constraints but produces a non-physical trajectory due to the lack of control regularization.
> 

## #2 Adding Control Smoothness Penalties (Thrust Rate & Angle Rate Penalty)

### **Key Features**

- A penalty on the rate of change of thrust is added:
    - Encourages smoother and more gradual thrust variation.
- A penalty on the rate of change of α is also imposed
- Additional bounds are placed on the angle:
    - $-90^\circ \le \alpha \le 90^\circ$
    
    reflecting realistic rocket actuation limits.

![image.png](Optimal%20Control%20Theory%20Project/image%205.png)

### **Analysis**

- The trajectory becomes noticeably more realistic, with controls evolving more smoothly across the time horizon.
- However, the landing phase still shows **significant downward velocity** in the vertical direction.
    
    → Despite smoother controls, no mechanism actively enforces a soft landing.
    
- Although the rocket tends to adopt an upright orientation, the lack of terminal refinement causes a hard touchdown.

> Conclusion: Smoothness penalties improve control realism but are insufficient for achieving a physically plausible soft landing.
> 

## #3 Introducing Terminal Condition on Vertical Acceleration

### **Key Feature**

- A terminal constraint enforcing **near-zero vertical acceleration** is introduced:
    - $\dot{v}_y(t_f) \approx 0$
    
    which guides the system toward reducing thrust-induced acceleration at touchdown.
    
- This effectively ensures:
    - $v_y(t_f)→0$  (soft landing),
    - No excessive thrust adjustments in the final phase,
    - A dynamically consistent deceleration profile.

### **Results**

- The rocket achieves a smooth descent, with near-zero vertical velocity and acceleration at touchdown.
- The thrust angle α(t) evolves smoothly and stays within physically meaningful bounds.
- The resulting trajectory closely resembles a realistic powered-descent maneuver.

> Conclusion: Adding a terminal acceleration constraint significantly improves landing quality, producing the most realistic and dynamically consistent solution among the three attempts.
> 

# Conclusion

- Initial formulations that only maximized final mass produced mathematically feasible but physically unrealistic behaviors, highlighting the need for additional constraints.
- Introducing penalties on thrust-rate and angle-rate reduced discontinuities in the control signals and improved physical plausibility.
- Adding a terminal constraint on vertical acceleration enabled a smoother touchdown and eliminated excessive downward velocity at landing.
- The final optimized trajectory exhibits smooth vertical landing motion and well-behaved control profiles within feasible operational ranges.

> These results confirm that careful cost-function design and constraint selection are critical for achieving physically meaningful solutions in trajectory optimization.
> 

- Direct Collocation does not inherently penalize unrealistic motion unless explicitly constrained through the cost or constraints.
- Hermite–Simpson defect constraints enforce dynamic feasibility but do not restrict the qualitative structure of the trajectory.
- The NLP solver is sensitive to initial guesses, and mesh refinement improves convergence robustness and smoothness.
- Adding physically motivated penalties or constraints significantly reduces the feasible search space, steering the optimizer to desirable solutions.

# Limitations and Constraints

- Because the problem is formulated with a fixed final time, the resulting trajectory does not necessarily represent a minimum-time landing.
- The computed solution focuses primarily on fuel efficiency under the prescribed time horizon, rather than exploiting shorter-duration descent strategies.
